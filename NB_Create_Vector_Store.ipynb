First, we read all markdown files in `/data/raw` as plain text files.\n","2. We proceed by splitting all documents by markdown headers. The intuition is to split the documents by the \"##\" header, assuming that everything within a section is related to the same topic. The file name and the header title are stored as metadata.\n","3.

Finally, we split the subsections into smaller, manageable chunks for the encoder, while retaining the metadata.\n","\n","**Phase 2: Document Augmentation**\n","\n","1. We augment each chunk with the original file title and section title to provide more contextual information. This helps the encoder model distinguish between different domains such as Conda, Git, Regex, etc.\n","2. Additionally, we augment each chunk using `Hypothetical Question Generation`. The idea is to ask a generative language model to come up with questions a user might ask, further assisting the encoder model in matching the chunk with a potential user query.\n","\n","**Example of a processed document:**\n","\n","The final document is augmented with the original section title and hypothetical questions.\n","\n","```\n","Page title: Initializing A Repository In An Existing Directory\n","Filename: git tutorial\n","\n","Related Questions:\n","- 1.
